## The NeoVim setup for the true heroes.

At some point in the weekend I'll provide install instructions here. Sorry for now boys!

### Q&A:

1. **Why did you fork every dependency for this setup?**

   Because I'm terrified of breaking changes and auto-updates. Once this setup is complete, I'll never update or change anything again, and it will stay beautiful and untouched as is till the end of the Universe.

2. **Where can I learn more about NeoVim and lua config files?**

   Go watch [ThePrimeagen's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) tutorial.

3. **How do I install stylua?**

   `cargo install stylua`

4. **Am I really a true hero?**

   Yes. You're also beautiful.

5. **What is that `cargo` command on item 3?**

   The answer for question `4` does not apply to you.
